# Network Graph Visualizer Frontend

This part of the Network Graph Visualizer is the Frontend written in Typescript using the React library.

## What does the Frontend do

The Frontend queries the Network Graph Visualizer API for the network topology and shows it on a webpage. All data is coming from the Jalape√±o instance queried by the API.
